# TravelTide Customer Retention: Perks Redefined
**Mastery Project - Ayomide Ajagbe**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addresses the declining retention rates at TravelTide by moving away from generic, margin-eroding discounts toward a data-driven, personalized rewards strategy. By analyzing over 5,900 active users, I developed a behavioral segmentation model that maps specific traveler "pain points" to high-value perks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
- **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Data extraction, cleaning, and cohort engineering.
- **Google Sheets:** Statistical analysis (Correlation testing) and data validation.
- **Canva:** Executive-level data visualization and storytelling.

### The Scope of Analysis
To ensure the analysis focused on high-lifetime-value (LTV) customers
- A behavioral floor of users with **>7 sessions**.
- Anchoring timeframe activity occurring **after January 4, 2023**.
- This resulted in a clean sample of **5,998 high-intent travelers**.


## 👥 Traveler Cohorts & Strategic Perks
I engineered six distinct cohorts based on demographics and behavioral data:

| Cohort | Defining Behavior | Recommended Perks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business** | Short stays, high frequency | No Cancellation Fees & Room Upgrades |
| **Family** | Married with children, high luggage | Free Checked Bags & Complimentary Kids Experience |
| **Senior** | Longest stay durations (5.6 nights) | 1 Night Free Hotel, Airport Aid, & TSA Fast Lane |
| **Dreamer** | High clicks, 0 bookings | Welcome Credit & 3-Day Price Freeze |
| **Young** | High engagement, price-sensitive | Student Reward Program (15% Credits) |
| **Standard** | Consistent, mid-range activity | Free Hotel Meals & Free Stay over 5-day period |

## 📈 Projected Business Impact
- **Retention Lift:** Projected **12-15% increase** in core segments.
- **Margin Protection:** Phasing out underperforming generic discounts to protect company profitability.
- **Brand Positioning:** Shifting TravelTide from a utility to a personalized travel partner.
